variable declaration is not compulsory.
but variables can be declared in 3 ways.
+	var
+	let
+	const

what is the difference between var, let and const?
+	const is to create an immutable (not modifiable) variable.
+	block means group of statements enclosed within curly braces.
+	const and let are block-scoped
+	var is function-scoped


How do you choose between for and while?
+	for loop is used when we want to iterate set of statements for a finite number of time
+	while loop is used when we want to iterate set of statements for an indefinite number of time
+	do..while loop is used when we want to execute set of statements atleast once.

creating an array:
-------------------
let arr = [10,20,30]

for .. in	:	return indexes
for .. of	:	return values
